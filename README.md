# GridPathing
This project tests various methods of AI to solve a simple grid problem.

## There are seven AI strategies used, presented in order of complexity:

1. Random
2. Random with backtracking disabled
3. Explicit business logic, moves as far as it can go and then turns clockwise.
4. Depth-first search
5. Depth-first search with back tracking disabled
6. Optimized Depth-first search
7. Reinforcement Learning Environment using OpenAI Gym and Ray.
